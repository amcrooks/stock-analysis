#VBA of Wall Street

##Overview of Project

- Initially we were creating an analysis to find out if the stock “DQ” was gaining or losing for Steve’s parents. Then he wanted to take a look at all stocks standing in the market. Which we created an analysis with buttons to see all stocks.

- For our code run time, we noticed that the refactored code ran 0.56 sec faster than our original for the year of 2018. In the year of 2017 the refactored ran 0.40 sec faster than our original code.

- For our stock analysis in 2018, we see a drop in majority of the stocks while two stocks seem to increase during this time.


##Summary

1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

	#Advantages
	
	- Refactoring seems to have simplified our code in parts, making it easier to read.
	
	- Also produced a quicker run time of the code.

	#Disadvantages
	
	- I’ve faced a lot difficult with constructing the refactor of our code, I ran into so many errors when running the code. If it wasn’t a function or equation error,  it would be an overflow error. 
	
	- Can be very time consuming if you have a large code which can make it easy to look over things.
